        <h2>Dua  is an English and Albanian singer and songwriter. To this day, she is one of the most influencial artists of the decade. Her sound can qualify as synth pop and she knows how to keep relevant her career.
          </h2>
          <h3>
            Let's make a little journey around her studio albums:
        <ul>
          <li>üíø Dua Lipa
            <p>Released in 2017, this is Dua's debut album who I discovered around 2019 with the song "Be the One". Immediately I knew Dua was going to be one of my top artists because she keeps a clean and rythmic sound, fresh and also good.</p>
          </li>
          <li>üíø Future Nostalgia
            <p>With an 80's like production, this was the album that set us all free from our minds on the pandemic, already four years ago. Starting with the song "Levitating", that ideated a lot of trends on TikTok platform, including remixes with songs like the Attack On Titan opening, and with the song "Don't Start Now" in the radios until today, this album made Dua Lipa rise to success.</p>
          </li>
          <li>üíø Radical Optimism
            <p>Finally, this month Dua released her new album, that involves the production of Kevin Parker (from Tame Impala) in songs like "Houdini", her first single from this album. Unfortunately, the album's reception is not the best in its first weeks, but we are hoping you all give an oportunity to this more mature sounding-like album.</p>
